    - header: Galvanize Software Development Immersive (SDI)
      descriptor: >
        Phoenix Spark and Galvanize have partnered to give Travis Airmen the opportunity to learn software development skills in a 12-week immersive program. The program is designed to give students the skills and experience to be successful in the software development industry. Students will learn the fundamentals of software development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Postgres, and React. Students will also learn how to work in a team environment, how to communicate effectively, and how to present their work to an audience. The program will culminate in a final project that will be presented to the wider USAF and United States Space Force (USSF) Travis communities.

    - header: In-House Software Development Courses
      descriptor: >
        <b>This Digital Initiative is currently under construction.</b>
        
        Phoenix Spark is working with the 60th Air Mobility Wing to create a software development course that will teach Airmen the fundamentals of software development.  The course will be taught by Airmen who have already completed the Galvanize Software Development Immersive program, or who already have real-world experience with a given programming language.  The languages taught will start out with basic JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, possibly expanding to cover other languages as personnel, time, and opportunity permit.  The course will be taught in a classroom setting and will be open to all Airmen on Travis AFB.

    - header: Platinum Grid
      descriptor: >
        Platinum Grid <i>(formerly 'SmartSheets')</i> is a program designed to track inventory or equipment.  Originally designed in Microsoft Access, Platinum Grid was redeveloped in JavaScript, CSS, and Postgres during SDI #10 as a capstone project.  The program is currently being optioned by the USSF/Space Camp and USAF HAF/A4 to track satellite information and aircraft part Tail Number Bin (TNB) information, respectively.  While not yet deployed for wider use, Platinum Grid's ability to generate QR-codes from entered data to better enable has the potential to transform how parts out of the supply system are tracked, and once installed on an aircraft, are replaced.

    - header: Microsoft PowerApps Development
      descriptor: >
        Microsoft PowerApps enable in-house, bespoke solutions for work center issues that can be resolved through digital means.  Whether this is the sharing of documents between sections, to creating a Petrol, Oil, and Lubrication (POL) dashboard to ensure aircraft receive fuel in a timely manner, to establishing a centrally available shift turnover log, PowerApps can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.  Phoenix Spark is developing a PowerApps training course to better leverage this tool set to make life easier at Travis AFB.

    header: Modernize your Software & Digital Talent
    descriptor: >
      Help us to create an environment within the US military and government at large where any service member or government civilian can become educated and enabled to contribute to the software that runs their lives & the lives of the people they represent, whether through code, product ownership, design, or elsewhere, in a manner that brings programmatic decision authority to the people who are closest to the mission.
