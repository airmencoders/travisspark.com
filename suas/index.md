      descriptor: >
        The 60th AMW is currently exploring a scaling effort to utilize sUAS to assist maintainers in executing historically high-risk
        maintenance activities such as T-Tail inspections on large mobility aircraft.

    - header: Border Perimeter Security
      descriptor: >
         The 60th SFS is working with an AFWERX SBIR company in testing and developing a prototype autonomous aerial monitoring system to deliver advanced perimeter security and situational awareness using autonomous self-deployed drones.  Currently they have 3 autonomous and 2 tethered units in production use.

    header: Modernize your TTPs with sUAS
    descriptor: >
      Small UAS tactics, techniques and procedures are not keeping pace with innovation, the demand for capability, or the growing threats emerging from malignant actors. The massive proliferation of  extreme-low-cost and autonomous aviation technologies, commonly referred to as sUAS or “drones,” creates a paradigm shift in the way global mobility operations are conducted. We are working on staying ahead of the wave!
