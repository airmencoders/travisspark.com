      - question: How are the top Spark Tank nominees selected?
        answer: >
          The top Spark Tank nominees, as selected by the Spark Tank Selection Board, are those that best meet the following criteria:
          <ul>
            <li>Originality
              - The idea is new and has not been previously implemented or attempted by Travis AFB. 

                NOTE:  If the idea has been attempted by Travis AFB, the idea must be significantly improved upon from the previous attempt.
            </li>
            <li>Feasibility
              - The idea is feasible and can be implemented within the current fiscal year.
            </li>
            <li>Impact</li>
            <li>Scalability</li>
          </ul>
      - question: If I am not selected as a top nominee, is my idea, initiative, or program still eligible to receive funding?
        answer: >
          Yes!  The top Spark Tank nominees are not the only submittals that receive funding.  The Spark Tank Selection Board, composed of civilians, NCO's, SNCO's, and officers, will also select a number of additional submittals to receive funding.  The number of additional submittals to receive funding will be determined by the amount of funding available once the top picks have all been purchased.
