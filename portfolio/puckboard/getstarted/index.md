      - header: <b>Step 3.</b> Sign up for Platform One SSO
        descriptor: <i>Already a Mattermost user? You can skip to step 4.</i>
        descriptor2: Puckboard is possible because it lives within the Air Forceâ€™s PlatformOne (P1) architecture and security. The key to accessing Puckboard, or any other mission apps on P1, is the Single Sign On (SSO). This allows you to work on any device, in any of the mission apps (like Puckboard, Mattermost, & Widow) using a single password. All of this is available to anyone with a .mil email and CAC card. <br><br> Use the button below to find our step by step guide to creating your P1 account.
        buttons:
          - text: Create your P1 Account
            url: p1
            isInternal: 'yes'
            newTab: 'yes'

      - header: <b>Step 4.</b> Submit a request to create your unit in Puckboard
        descriptor: Now that you have a P1 SSO account, you can login to our Service Desk and request a new unit for Puckboard.
        descriptor2: The team then creates your unit and reaches out to ensure that all personnel are uploaded properly.

      - header: <b>Step 5.</b> Implement and train
        descriptor: This is the fun part, where you get to work with the training and onboarding team to implement Puckboard for your unit.
        descriptor2: Your P1 SSO grants access to our internal knowledge base and Mattermost team where we work with you on implementing best practices, and ensure that you will be ready to succeed at go-live. Join the community where you can find best practices, ask questions, and get help on any Puckboarding subject in our Puckboard Team on the Mattermost chat software.

        descriptor: Puckboard is developed using User Centered Design and Agile methodology, meaning that we fight for you, the user.
        descriptor2: If you have suggestions on how to make Puckboard better, or want to submit feature suggestions, submit a request in the Service Desk. You can see what other users have submitted and vote on their ideas. You can also ask questions in our Confluence space, stay informed on releases, and even get involved with feature design.
