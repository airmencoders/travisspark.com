         Additive manufacturing, combined with computer automated design, gives you the powerful capability to turn a mental vision into a tangible product.  Whether you are making parts to assist the mission, learning to print coins for your unit, or even making toys to donate to the community, additive manufacturing can help to prototype, refine, and build quickly.
