## How to Edit files before committing them:

### Install Ruby

First, make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed. You can confirm this by running `ruby -v` on the command line:

```sh
$ ruby -v
ruby [version number] (date) [your platform]
```

If you get something like `"Error, command not found"` visit the link above and
install Ruby for your platform.


## Install Jekyll and Bundler

``` bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### Read Jekyll tutorial
Go through the steps to learn `jekyll` in the tutorial here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/

### Make sure you have Bundler

Next, make sure you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io) installed. Just like
above, run `bundle -v` on the command line:

```sh
$ bundle -v
bundle [version number]
```

If you get `"Error, command not found"` run `gem install bundler` to install it
using RubyGems.
