        Digital DNA provides digital foundations and applies them within the context of the Defense
        Acquisition System (DAS). This course will not teach you how to code in Java or how to manage cloud
        infrastructure, rather it aims to teach how to create and execute acquisition strategies and contracts
        that support the speed of technology and change, navigate the overall DAS, and how to communicate
        with stakeholders and leadership. You deserve a training experience that motivates and inspires you
        to continue learning and discovering new ways to solve the DoD’s most challenging problems.

      - question: How do I know if this course is right for me?
        answer: >
          If you are a government member working in a program office or are a stakeholder for a software-intensive system, wanting a course that helps you understand modern software practices and how to integrate them in your program, desiring to improve your understanding of modern software practices, or simply wanting to explore work on emerging technology programs in the future...then you are a perfect fit!
      - question: I am a government member, but have never worked acquisitions.  Can I take this course?
        answer: > 
          Absolutely!  By virtue of being a passionate technologist in a functional community, you are a prime candidate for being a technical point of contact or contracting officer representative for a future project within Tron or elsewhere.  We need as many people to understand the nuances of acquisition as possible if we want to bring modern technology into the government.
      - question: When is the next course?
        answer: 24 Mar - 8 Apr 2021
      - question: Who pays for the course?
        answer: Right now the course is covered by DAU and Tron.  Future course costs are TBD.
