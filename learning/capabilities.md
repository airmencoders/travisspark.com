Here you will find the underlying concepts covered within each of the ***capability milestones*** offered by Tron.  In this context, a ***capability*** is a description of a functional skillset that can provide someone with the abilty to provide a nontrivial increase in production value to a software team.

A ***capability milestone*** is defined as the smallest collection of concepts that must be known to provide someone with the functional skill that encompasses a new capability.  Various capabilities (& associated milestones) can be combined to build qualifications for filling a role on a production software team.

For Air Force members, when a capability milestone is met through one of the various Tron learning pathways, the person completing the milestone is eligible to receive an Individual Capability (ICM) code through MyVector to facilitate future talent management/assignment opportunities.

Mechanisms for completion of these capability milestones can be found in the <a href="/learning/pathways">Learning Pathways section</a>.
Definition of the roles that can be filled by each qualification can be found in the <a href="/learning/qualifications">Roles</a> Section.
Definition of the sufficient qualifications for filling a given role can be found in the <a href="/learning/capabilities">Qualifications</a> Section.
